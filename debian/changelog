  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * New Upstream Version (svn revision 16838 libswscale revision 28380)
  
  Upstream Changes:
    - R3D REDCODE demuxer
    - ALSA support for playback and record
  
  * strighten internal dependencies by using a shlibs.local file
    Closes: #512844, #512466
  * New upstream version reintroduces a compatibility symbol ff_gcd
    Closes: #512946
  * Bump shlibs because of changes of the Metadata API in libavformat.
    Actually no other package should use them yet, but let's better play safe 
    here...
  * no longer install dsputil.h. It exposes lots of function that are private
    to ffmpeg and may change on any new upstream revision. Please get in touch
    with the ffmpeg maintainers if you maintain packages that rely on that
    ffmpeg internal headers like this.
  * simplify debian/confflags by doing autodetection of headers:
     - xvid.h
     - lame/lame.h
     - faac.h
     - x264.h
     - vdpau/vdpau.h
    Also remove the setting externalcodecs from DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. The codecs 
    will be enabled as soon as the headers are installed on the filesystem,
    so there is no need in enabling that seperately.
  
  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * Enabled Speex decoding via libspeex.
  * Use an alternative approach to achieve strict internal dependencies
    by calling dh_makeshlibs twice in debian/rules instead of a
    debian/shlibs.local file.

  * new upstream svn snapshot (svn revision 16508, libswscale revision 28286)
  
  Upstream Changes:
   - RV30 and RV40 decoder
   - QCELP / PureVoice decoder
  
  * removed patch 050_fix_pkgconfig_files.patch. Merged upstream
  * disabled patch 020_visibility_patch. It needs to be adapted to the new
    upstream changes. Hopefully it will get merged into ffmpeg properly.
  * install formats.txt in the libavcodec52 package to document what
    formats this version of ffmpeg has enabled.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Tweak sed versions regexps to deal with epochs and upstream revisions with
    dashes and be generally stricter.
  * Large cleanup to rules logic: drop some cruft, rewrite some small chunks
    in a slightly more readable manner, whitespaces, .PHONY fixes,
    internalencoders handling, shlibs logic...
  * Rename SRC_VERSION to UPSTREAM_VERSION in rules.
  * Use DEB_SOURCE from the Source: field of dpkg-parsechangelog's output
    instead of hardcoding the name of the source.

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * new svn snapshot (svn revision 15404, libswscale revision 27636).
  * SONAME change: libavcodec51 -> libavcodec52
  * drop old scaler (imgres/imgconvert). Upstream is about to remove it
    completely.
    - reporter claims that a newer snapshot fixes a crash in the dca decoder.
      Thanks to "Alexander E. Patrakov" <patrakov@gmail.com> (Closes: #496612)
  * reenable h261 encoder (Closes: #459073)

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * debian/{ffmpeg,lib*-dev}.install:
    + Simplified, e.g. install the whole /usr/include/ sub-directory for each
      particular library instead of single header files one by one.
  * debian/control, debian/confflags:
    + Enabled Dirac support via libschroedinger. (Closes: #499785)
  * debian/changelog:
    + Added an epoch needed for Ubuntu.
  * debian/control:
    + Removed Conflicts and Replaces against packages that either aren't even
      in Debian 4.0 "Etch" anymore or that use the deprecated naming scheme
      from <http://www.debian-multimedia.org>.
    + Since ffmpeg-config has been removed from our packages, all inter-package
      Conflicts and Replaces may be removed, too.
    + Removed Build-Conflicts against libdc1394-13-dev, because
      libdc1394-22-dev already does this for us.
    + Updated inter-package dependencies and demoted Depends on external
      library packages to Suggests, since we shouldn't encourage package
      maintainers to link statically against libav*.
  * debian/confflags, debian/control, debian/rules, debian/libavfilter*:
    + Built libavfilter and disabled vhook in turn (Closes: #499787).

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Remove debug echo which broke shlibs, sorry.
  * Fix Vcs-* control fields; thanks Gerfried Fuchs.
  * Mention upstream SVN in debian/copyright; thanks Gerfried Fuchs;

    from upstream svn.
  * bugfix: libraries linked with libX11 on GNU/kFreeBSD. Thanks to

  * enable mmx and sse3 in builds. These CPU features are autodetected 
    at runtime on amd64 and i386 using the 'cpuid' instrcution.
    (Closes: #489732)
  * disable support for liba52-dev. ffmpeg has its own implementation.
  * don't add -fPIC -DPIC forcefully to ./configure. upstream claim that
    the configure script gets this right on all architectures itself.
  * Add patch 020_bug489965_bufferoverflow_str_demuxer.diff. Fixes a
    buffer overflow in the STR demuxer. Thanks to Moritz Muehlenhoff for
    reporting the issue. (Closes: #489965)
  * Raising severity to high because of security issue.
  * rework the shlibs file. Make applications linking against libraries
    produced by this source package generate an alternate dependency on
    the 'unstripped' variants of this package. They actually do not exist
    yet at this point, but this way reverse dependencies are enabled to
    use them when they eventually appear.

ffmpeg-debian (0.svn20080206-9) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * cleanup 010_proper_rpath.diff: remove spurious linker search paths.
  * debian/strip.sh: no need to remove the glue code for x264 and xvid.
    However, since that code is not built in debian anyway, the orig.tar.gz
    was not rebuilt with this change.
  * provide mmx-enabled shared objects on amd64. AFAIK all amd64 machines
    do support MMX.
  * Provide optimized versions of the libraries along the unoptimized
    ones. They are installed in machines and architecture specific
    directories. Optimized for further target will be added per request,
    please file bugs to request them.
  * rename the source package (again), this time on upstream's request.
    The former name was considered insulting by upstream, because it
    somewhat indicated the original source was somehow 'non-free', which is
    not the case. The new name now represents that we modified the package
    so that it becomes acceptable for debian.
  * Cleanups in debian/rules file.
  * Add verbose explanations about the renaming in README.Debian.

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * debian/control:
    + Added Conflicts and Replaces against obsolete library packages from
      <http://debian-multimedia.org/> wearing the 'cvs' suffix in their names
      (Closes: #484585, #484586, #484587, #484776, #484778).
    + Added doxygen to Build-Depends.
    + Introduced new package 'ffmpeg-doc' that contains html doxygen
      documentation of the ffmpeg API (Closes: #438369).
    + Changed Build-Depends from libdc1394-13-dev to libdc1394-22-dev,
      which is supported upstream since r11501.
  * debian/ffmpeg-doc.install:
    + Added.
  * debian/rules:
    + Build and install html doxygen documentation.
    + Avoid dependency of build-stamp rule on phony targets.
  * debian/libavutil-dev.install, debian/rules,
    debian/patches/010_ffmpeg-config.diff:
    + Removed ffmpeg-config, use pkg-config instead (maintainers of affected
      packages have been informed, see #487917 to #487922).

  [ Darren Salt ]
  * Added patch 900_doxyfile: tell doxyfile to ignore debian* directories.
  * debian/rules:
    - Reworked building so that separate source & build directories are
      used. This makes cleanup simpler and speeds up maintenance by avoiding
      complete rebuilds when using "debuild binary".
    - Removed some file installation 'cp' commands, made unnecessary due to
      the build reworking.
    - Unpatching is now done *after* cleaning.

  * debian/control:
    + Added Conflicts and Replaces on libavutil-dev (<< 0.svn20080206-7)
      to libavcodec-dev (Closes: #483548).

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]

  * remove patches from the debian package as disussed with upstream:
    - 005_runtime_cpudetect.diff: it is supposed to fix runtime cpu detection
      on i386. The code (and the define) has undergone large refactoring wrt.
      the define RUNTIME_CPUDETECT. It is very likely to have undisired
      side-effects with this version of ffmpeg. It therefore seem more safe
      to me to actually remove this patch for now, and reinvestigate the
      problems that occur, if they do.  (Related to: #482717)
    - 005_m68k_workaround.diff: works around bugs in gcc for m68k.
    - 006_mips_pthreads.diff: was an workaround for (now fixed) #428741.
    - 020_fix_sws_scale_crash: patch has been rejected upstream:
      http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2008-May/047846.html
    - 054_h264_mmx_chroma_mc_crash.diff. According to upstream, this has
      been fixed in a different way and is not reproducible. Verified that
      the file referenced in bug #404176 does not crash anymore even
      without this patch.
  * new patch: 015_reenable-img_convert.diff.  Unlike previous version of this
    patch, this uses a more lightweight approach. With building imgresample, a
    few symbol clashes occur with libswscale. We therefore strip off symbols
    that are already provided by libswscale. (Closes: #483960).
  * remove 011_link_plugins.diff. It is completely unnecessary now.
  * refactor quilt usage: use /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make.
  * support building in paralell. make snippet taken from the qemu package.
  * cleanups in debian/rules.
  * Move ffmpeg-config back to libavutil. This way we can avoid a circular
    dependency between libavutil-dev and libavcodec-dev. (Closes: #484132).
    libavcodec uses libavutil internally, so this dependency cannot be avoided.
  * disable altivec, at least for now. (Closes: #482717)
  * always compile with --disable-strip. We strip the binaries afterwards using
    dh_strip anyways.
  * Remove depdency substitutions ${shlibs:Depends} and ${misc:Depends} from the
    -dev packages.

  * debian/libavcodec.install, debian/libavutil.install:

  * debian/control:
    + Fixed dependency typo, libswscale0 conflicts with libswsacle1d but not
      libswscale1d (Closes: #481908).

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * disable 015_build_imgresample.diff. Please port all applications
    needing the symbols sws_{scale,getContext},
    sws_{getCachedContext,freeContext} to use libswscale instead.
  * downgrade debhelper depencency to level 5. We don't use any of the
    level 6 features, and level 5 faciliates backporting to earlier
    releases massively.
  * remove unapplied patches from source to reduce the size of the
    .diff.gz. The old patches can be retrieved from branches in our svn.

ffmpeg-free (0.svn20080206-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    + Moved confflags, that result in GPL versions of the libraries, into a
      dedicated variable gpl_confflags. Add this to the common confflags.
    + Moved --prefix=/usr to the common confflags.
    + Added some comments and whitespace (nothing special).
    + Renamed the "risky" keyword to "internalencoders". Set this in
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS in order to create and build from an unstripped tarball
      in the get-orig-source and build rules (Closes: #478010).
    + Introduced the "externalcodecs" keyword. Set this in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to
      enable support for additional codecs via external libraries.
    + Commented out the amr?b codecs among the external codecs, because the
      resulting packages will be unredistributable.

  * patches/020_fix_sws_scale_crash: if sws_scale is given an invalid context
    (e.g. a null pointer), the function will crash because of a null pointer
    dereference. Add a check for that here.
  * add Conflicts/Replaces for libswscale1d.
  * Due to the fact that we no longer build the shared version of ffmpeg with
    mmx optimisations, the following patches have been dropped:
      - 020_mmx_optims.diff
      - 020_mmx_pic_code.diff

    + Build ffmpeg and shared libraries with --extra-cflags="-fPIC -DPIC"
      (feeling confident that this closes: #472613) and "drop the surgery
      regarding Makefile.pic and config.mak.pic".
    + In this context, cleaned up build rule: Run '$(MAKE)' and '$(MAKE) clean'
      from the top source directory instead of diving into the library
      directories; force move during backup and recovery of the static
      libraries; let the build rule itself depend on config-extra-includes.h
      (instead of build-stamp) to avoid being run again from the binary rule;
      some more minor changes of cosmetic type.
    + Renamed config-extra-includes rule to config-extra-includes.h to
      reflect the file name of the created file (also changed to override it
      instead of appending) and to avoid the rule to be run twice.

  * remove --enable-libdts. ffmpeg now has an internal dts decoder since
    r9051 (2007-05-17). It seems that at least some packages link to libdts and
    rely on the transitive dependency via ffmpeg. Please add explicit dependencies
    on libdts instead!
  * Don't ignore errors in upstream Makefile. Bug found via lintian.
